I'm a PhD student in the [Computation and Neural Systems](https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/academics/cns) program at Caltech. I am advised by Professor [Pietro Perona](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j29kMCwAAAAJ&hl=en).

Research Interests
----
<font size="3">
I'm interested in the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence. How do humans develop generalizable representations? Where does human cognition and artificial intelligence differ? <br/><br/>
Currently, I'm working on the problem of machine teaching. We aim to take a trained model and produce effective, personalized teaching material for human students. I envision a pipeline in which a few experts provide data to train a model and this model is passed to a teaching algorithm that does the difficult work of producing teaching material for students. My intention with this work is to make expert instruction available to students from diverse, potentially underpriveledged backgrounds.

Background
----
<font size="3">
I'm from Cupertino, CA and attended Monta Vista High School. In undergrad, I did my B.S. in Physiology & Neuroscience with a minor in Computer Science at the University of California San Diego. As a student at UCSD, I did systems neuroscience research in the Komiyama Lab for two years and neuroeconomics research with Dr. Pamela Reinagel for one year. During these years, I developed an interest in artificial neural networks and, upon graduation, decided to join the <a href="https://www.vision.caltech.edu">Computational Vision Group</a> at Caltech.</font>

I'm a PhD student in the Computation and Neural Systems program at Caltech, advised by Pietro Perona. 

Research Interests
======
I'm interested in the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence. How do humans develop generalizable representations? Where does human cognition and artificial intelligence differ? Currently, I'm working on the problem of machine teaching -- we aim to take a trained model and produce effective, personalized teaching material for human students. I envision a pipeline in which a few experts provide data to train a model and this model is passed to a teaching algorithm that does the difficult work of producing teaching material for students. My intention is for this work to make expert instruction available to students from diverse, (potentially) underpriveledged backgrounds and is related to some of my volunteer work.

Background
======
I'm originally from Cupertino, CA and attended Monta Vista High School. I did my BS in Physiology and Neuroscience with a minor in Computer Science at the University of California San Diego. As a student at UCSD, my first research experience was in a systems neuroscience lab led by Dr. Takaki Komiyama. In the Komiyama Lab, I studied the changes that mice brains underwent when they learned a new motor task. This first experience solidified my interest in research and started me on my current path. In my time there, I developed an interest in developing algorithms to reduce some of our manual workload and explored some primitive computer vision techniques. I then joined the Reinagel group to study rat decision making through a neuro-economic lens. I modelled when rats would seek out water with respect to several environmental varaibles. After starting at Caltech, I decided I was most interested in artifical intelligence and computer vision which led me to the Computaional Vison Group.
